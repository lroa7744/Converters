Hello reader!

INTRODUCTION
This solution contains all the projects required to make the Converters Application
a reality. The application has been built using the ASP.NET Core Web App project type,
and some supporting Class Libraries.

REQUIREMENTS
The application has the following dependencies:

1. .NET 7.0 framework
2. Microsoft SQL Server database

NOTES
Please host this app on a webserver that has the relevant runtime(s) installed.

There is an "appsettings.json" file in the "Converters.Web.App" project. In there you
will find a "Default" connection string. This will need updating so it points to
your Microsoft SQL Server.

I hope you enjoy using this application as much I as did making it!
